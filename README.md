## User Guide
### Open File
1.  Navigate to **Import** and click **Upload** from computer.
2.  Select the image you wish to work with. (Ideally .tiff)
### Get Started
Once image is opened, a pop up will ask you to calibrate the distance.
1.  Click ok and then click either side of the ruler in the image.
2.  Another popup will show up asking you how far the two points you clicked were.
3.  The default is 10 micrometers but this can be altered if the ruler is a different length.
### Automation
1. Navigate to **Automation** and click **Activate**
2. Click Yes in the pop up to start automation. This process is going to take some time. (* You will see a Status: Automating... on the right bottom corner of the window which indicates the process is still ongoing.)
3. Once finished, you will see green squares and blue nodes. The green squares are areas where the cells were too crowded to differentiate between and should be examined by a human.
4. In order to add new nodes, you need to holding down `cmd` on Mac, `ctrl` on Windows, and click on the **Activate**  again to remove green squares.
### Add Nodes
To add a node, select the type from the left side and simply click on the cell you wish to place it. The nodes are on the left, in descending order â€“ normal, spherical cells, curved cells, and long cells.
### Add Edeges
To add an edge, select the type from the left side and click two spots between which an edge will appear. The edges are below the cells in descending order, cell to cell, cell to surface, and cell to cell contact. The program will connect the two nodes closest to the spots you have clicked.
### Delete Edges
Keep holding down `cmd` on Mac, `ctrl` on Windows, you will see a dot appear on the center of the edges, and click on the center dot on the edge you intend to delete.
### Delete Nodes
Keep holding down `cmd` on Mac, `ctrl` on Windows, click nearby the node you intend to delete.
### Save File
To save navigate to Export. Click Save file. A window will pop up, choose where to save the project, and what to name it.
### Export
To export navigate to Export. Click Export to Gephi to create a .csv file. Click Export to Cytoscape to create a .gexf, this is the recommended choice. These will just create a file with the exported information in the same folder. You can then navigate to this and load it into gephi. Both file types are recognized by gephi.
### Import from Saved File
To upload this saved file navigate to Import. Click Upload from saved projects and select the file. It should load to where you were before.
